                <h2>The Setting</h2>
                <p>Decide what the world that surrounds the protagonists is like.</p>
                <p>You’re probably already familiar with the idea of a setting, but in short,
                it’s everything that the characters interact with, such as people, organizations and institutions,
                technology, strange phenomena, and mysteries (crime, intrigue, and cosmic or historical legend).
                These are the sort of things that characters want to engage with, are forced to engage with,
                look to for help, or stand in their way.</p>

                <p>If you’re using a setting that already exists, from a movie, novel, or other game book,
                then many of these ideas are ready for you to use. Of course, you’ll also likely add your own spin
                on things: new organizations or different mysteries to uncover.</p>

                <p>If you’re inventing a setting, you have more work cut out for you. It’s beyond the scope of this
                chapter to tell you how to make a setting. If you choose to do that it is assumed that you already
                know how to build one. (Besides, we live in a vast world of media. See tvtropes.org if you don’t believe us.)
                One word of advice, though—don’t try to invent too much up front. As you’ll see in the Game Creation section,
                you’re going to be generating a lot of ideas just through the process of game and character creation,
                so the details will come in time.</p>

                <h3>Decide how epic or personal your story will be.</h3>
                <p>The setting might be small or it might be vast, but where your stories take place determines the scale of your game.</p>

                <p>In a small-scale game, characters deal with problems in a city or region, they don’t travel a great deal,
                and the problems are local. A large-scale game involves dealing with problems that affect a world,
                a civilization, or even a galaxy if the genre you’re playing in can handle that kind of thing. (Sometimes,
                a small-scale game will turn into a large-scale one over time, as you’ve probably seen in long-running novel
                series or television shows.)</p>
